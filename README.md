# Kiailandi.github.io

A simple page to talk about me and what I would like to do with my life.

Mostly an excuse to *start doing something* and remember myself how much I have to learn and how little time I have to do so.

Anything you see here, other than *minimalcss* (which was the starting point), is probably "handmade", as this site should represent my "state of the art".

*any critique is more than welcome*
